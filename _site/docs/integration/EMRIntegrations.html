<p>IRIS is a SAAS service hosted in the Azure cloud environment.  In order to provide seamless integration to your on premise EMR/EHR IRIS provides the EMR Proxy application that you install on a Windows server in the data center where your EMR/EHR application resides. The primary function of the EMR Proxy is to provide encryption services for HL7 data in transit between your Integration engine and the IRIS Cloud services.</p>
