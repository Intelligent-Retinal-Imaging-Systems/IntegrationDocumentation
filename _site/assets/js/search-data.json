    "content": "The OrderControlCode specifies which action to take (use the abbreviation only): . | NW – Create New Order . | XO – Change Order . | CA – Cancel Order . | . Regardless of the control code, the same OrderRequest structure is used, however when using the CA code to cancel an order, you only need to populate the ClientGuid, Site LocalId and Order LocalId. Changing or Cancelling an order will not work if the target order is closed. Status updates will be supported in the 2022 Fall Release for the Events queue which will allow you to listen for events such as failed updates. Site structure . The Site structure is primarily used to identify the site the order is to be associated with. If your organization is configured as such, sites can be dynamically added, therefore additional fields are provided to supply the required information. If you don’t require automatic site additions, simply provide the LocalId. Iris Cloud DIRECT Integration . Site Fields . | LocalId – Id of site as specified by you, the submitting organization | Name – Name of the site (Only required for automatic site additions) | Address – Address for site (Only required for automatic site additions) | . Camera structure . When an order is to be assigned to a camera or Image directives are included with the order, populate this structure. If the camera already exists and you are not providing image directives, you only need to supply the LocalId. Other than the Images structure, the remaining fields are provided in the event your organization allows automatic Camera additions. Camera Fields: . | LocalId – Typically this is the serial number of the Camera. Because Iris supports a wide variety of cameras, some of which do not identify within image metadata, you may have to consult with Iris to find the proper value to supply here. | Location – Optionally specify a location where the camera is located. This is optional even when attempting to add a camera. | IPAddress – When specified, the camera is identified by the source IP Address as images are received. This is an atypical workflow and should only be used under direct request from Iris. | MACAddress – Optional identifier for informational purposes only | SerialNumber – Serial Number of Camera | Manufacturer – Name of camera manufacturer. Consult with Iris for exact values you should use. | Model – Model name of camera. Consult with Iris for exact values you should use. | SoftwareVersion – Version of camera software. Consult with Iris for exact values you should use. | Images (array of Image structure) – Provide image directives. This field is used when the workflow is started with the simultaneous receipt of order and images. | . Images array . The Images array is an array of Image structures that provides details including the storage location of one or more images associated with the order. Image structure . The Image structure allows you to specify details including the storage location where an image file can be retrieved. At this time, image retrieval is only supported in Azure Blob Storage. The Image structure has the following fields: . | LocalId – Id as specified by the submitting organization | Taken – DateTimeOffset when the image was taken | AzureBlobStorage – structure with blob storage location information | Laterality (options) – OD, OS | ImageContext (options) – Primary, Secondary, Component, Aggregate, Enhancement – Unless otherwise directed, Primary should be used. Non-primary images are not prominently displayed throughout the workflow. | ParentLocalId – If the image is a child of another image in the set, this is the LocalId value for that parent image | GroupId – If this image is part of an overall group of images, specify the group id here | GroupOrdinal – If this image is part of a group (specified by GroupId) this is the relative position in that group. | . AzureBlobStorage structure . Files in Azure Blob storage are specified by a container and filename. The Blob Storage Location in Azure is specific to an Azure Blob Storage resource of which connectivity access is specified in the Adminstrator application. The structure has the following fields: . | Container – Name of the container | FileName – name of the file found in the container | . ",

If your workflow is configured to have a default ordering provider, it is not necessary to include this information. However, if you are not configured for a default ordering provider, the order will error. If you are providing an NPI that links to a previously used Provider, NPI is the only required field. Otherwise, Name is the only requiement. While NPI and Taxonomy are not required, it could have downstream effects on the order results if that information is expected. | NPI – Providers National Identifier | Taxonomy – Optionally specify Taxonomy relavant to the action | Name – First, Last name | Email – Optionally specify an email address | Degrees – Optionally supply degrees | Associations – Optionall supply associations | . Patient structure . Iris allows submitting detailed information on a patient, however, in most workflows the only requirement is Id, Name, DOB and Gender. Providing the starting DxCode (ICD-10) serves as the foundation for a fully qualified ICD-10 code when pathology is found. | LocalId – Id of patient as specified by the submitting organization.

    "title": "Order structure",
    "content": "What you provide in the Order structure is highly dependent on your workflow. While the only required field is the Evaluation Type to perform, other fields may be required in your workflow. For example, the State field is required for mobile type exams where the location of the exam (where the images are taken) is in a different state than the Site the exam is tied to. See the description of each field for more details. The Iris system allows only one open order per patient/evaluation type combination. When using the LocalId, previous (open) orders could automatically be cancelled in favor of the newer order. For this reason, it is recommended that you supply the LocalId field so the system can more clearly identify when cancellations are the desired outcome. EvaluationTypes (array of options) – Specifies which evaluations to perform. Typically, only one evaluation is performed in an order but the Iris system can support multiple thus usage of an array for this field. Options are : DR, Glaucoma, and HIV . ScheduledTime – When orders are scheduled for a specific time, this should be that time local to the exam location. This is typically used for workflows where orders are pushed to Cameras as this determines which items show in a Camera worklist . LocalId – The Id of the order as specified by the submitting organization. This id is required for subsequent Change and Cancel operations. • DepartmentId – Optional identifier for the submitting department. Some EMR integrations will require this. EncounterNumber - Optional identifier for the encounter that generated the order. Some EMR integrations will require this field. StudyInstanceUniqueId - Optional Identifier, typically used with DICOM integrated cameras . OrderableIdentifier – Optional identifier . CPTCode – Procedure code . AdditionalInfo – Free form field for edge cases . • State – US State where exam is to be performed. Required for mobile exams that will not be performed at the address specified in the Site. This takes either the State abbreviation or Full name . • SingleEyeOnly (true/false) – If true, the order will not delay in the image pipeline after images are received on one eye.

AWS and Google Queues . It is assumed that the choice to use AWS or Google Queue indicates a preexisting knowledge of how those resources work, therefore no coding examples are provided here. Regardless of the transport mechanism, the payload (OrderResults Object) is the same. Queue Authentication . Regardless of the cloud platform, some form of connection credentials are required for access to the resource. When using Iris Azure Cloud resources, you must obtain the connection string from the Administrator application as a user with the Integration Administrator role. Otherwise you must supply the credentials in the Administrator application. Obtaining Iris Azure Service Bus Connection String . Similar to Orders submiision the connection string for the Results Service Bus is obtained in the Adminstrator application. This connection string has read-only privileges. • Login the the Iris Administrator application . • Navigate to the EMR integration page . • Select the “Result Delivery” tab . Select “Cloud Queue” under primary delivery methods . Select “IRIS Azure Cloud” from the cloud service provider options . Press the “Create Gateway” button . After generating the resource, the connection string will be made available . AWS, Azure and Google Service Bus/Queue Connection . To configure results to be pushed to an AWS, Azure (In your subscription) or Google Queue, the Integration Administrator must perform the following actions: . Login to the Iris Administrator application . Navigate to the EMR Integration page . Select the “Result Delivery” tab . • Select “Cloud Queue” under primary delivery methods . • Select AWS, AZURE or Google from the cloud service provider options . • Configure the following fields for AWS . o Queue Name . o Queue ARN .

    "content": "This document outlines the values sent in an HL7 results message (ORU-R01) from IRIS to a third-party system. This third-party system could be another application, an interface engine, or an EMR. For the purposes of this documentation, this third-party will be referred to an EMR. IRIS uses HL7 v2.4 as a main protocol for message sharing. If there are any fields represented in this document that are not populated but required by a receiving EMR, IRIS will populate these value(s) as requested. If the receiving EMR requires a different version, IRIS can provide messages for the corresponding version. If the EMR expects messages to be delivered in a format other than HL7, this will need to be discussed with an IRIS Interface Engineer as this will not be covered in the scope of this document – please contact IRIS support for more information. Following this section, the rest of the document will be divided by HL7 segment types as they would appear in a delivered HL7 message. IRIS has two different methods for delivering the document in an OBX segment: encoded PDF or pointer link (static URL). This will be described in detail later in that section. The last section of this document contains an example HL7 message. Customization . This document provides the default implementation of IRIS results to an HL7 ORU message. These mappings can be customized to suite your requirements. Customization can either be performed by an IRIS integration specialist or if desired you may designate an individual within your organization with the Integrator role providing them access to the IRIS Integration application.
