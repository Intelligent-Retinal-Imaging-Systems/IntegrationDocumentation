If you do not wish to use your own cloud service subscription, Iris can also provide this functionality in the Iris Azure subscription, referred to in this document as Iris Azure Cloud. In all cases, communication is accommodated using the cloud vendors APIs, SDKs or libraries. For many languages, IRIS provides native libraries,referred to as the IRIS Public libraries, to abstract the Cloud operations and to provide serialization and deserialization from the data models. ",

    "content": "Before you can submit an order using Cloud Direct services, the are several pieces of data you will need from IRIS: . | Service Bus Connection String | Your Organization Identifier referred to as ClientGuid | Site identifier(s) | . Orders Service Bus Connection String . Because orders are only submitted on a service bus that lives within the Iris Azure subscription, you must obtain the connection string from Iris. This connection string has write-only privileges. To obtain the connection string contact IRIS Support at support@irishelp.zendesk.com. Organization Identifier . Created by IRIS during provisioning, this is a GUID value passed into all order submissions, uniquely identifying your organization. Site Identifiers . Depending on your specific needs you will have one to many sites within the IRIS system assigned to your organization. Orders have a direct relationship to the site therefore an identifier for the site must be included in your submission. If you operate within a brick and mortar type model, you typically will want to have one site in the IRIS system per physical location your cameras reside. If you operate more in a mobile workflow, you typically have a single site. In the multisite mode, the state where the exam is performed is assumed to be the state configured on the site record within IRIS. If you operate in a single site mode, you must provide the state where the exam occurs in the order object. For single site workflows, IRIS will provide you with the identifier to supply for the Site. This because it’s not an identifier you established yourself. For multisite workflows, you will provide IRIS with your identifiers for each site as they are added. This can be done programmatically through this interface or through the Administrator application. If added from this interface you must include all the required properties for adding a new site in the Site structure. This is described in full detail in the site structure section. ",

If your organization is configured as such, sites can be dynamically added, therefore additional properties are provided to supply the required information. If you don’t require automatic site additions, simply provide the LocalId. Properties . | Property | Type | Description | . | LocalId | string | Id of site as specified by you, the submitting organization | . | Name | string | Name of the site (Only required for automatic site additions) | . | Address | Address structure | Address of site (Only required for automatic site additions) | . Camera structure . When an order is to be assigned to a camera or Image directives are included with the order, populate this structure. If the camera already exists and you are not providing image directives, you only need to supply the LocalId. Other than the Images structure, the remaining properties are provided in the event your organization allows automatic Camera additions. Properties . | Property | Type | Description | . | LocalId | string | Typically this is the serial number of the Camera. Because Iris supports a wide variety of cameras, some of which do not identify within image metadata, you may have to consult with Iris to find the proper value to supply here. | . | Location | string | Optionally specify a location where the camera is located. This is optional even when attempting to add a camera. | . | IPAddress | string | When specified, the camera is identified by the source IP Address as images are received. This is an atypical workflow and should only be used under direct request from IRIS | . | MACAddress | string | Optional identifier for informational purposes only | . | SerialNumber | string | Serial Number of Camera | . | Manufacturer | string | Name of camera manufacturer.

Consult with Iris for exact values you should use. | . | SoftwareVersion | string | Version of camera software. Consult with Iris for exact values you should use. | . | Images | Array of Image | Provide image directives. This field is used when the workflow is started with the simultaneous receipt of order and images. | . Images array . The Images array is an array of Image structures that provides details including the storage location of one or more images associated with the order. Image structure . The Image structure allows you to specify details including the storage location where an image file can be retrieved. At this time, image retrieval is only supported in Azure Blob Storage. Properties . | Property | Type | Description | Options | . | LocalId | string | Id as specified by the submitting organization |   | . | Taken | DateTimeOffset | When the image was taken |   | . | AzureBlobStorage | structure | blob storage location information |   | . | Laterality | options | Left or right eye | OD, OS | . | ImageContext | options | Unless otherwise directed, Primary should be used.

The Blob Storage Location in Azure is specific to an Azure Blob Storage resource of which connectivity access is specified in the Administrator application. Properties . | Property | Type | Description | . | Container | string | Name of the container | . | FileName | string | name of file as found in the container | . RequestProvider structure . The RequestProvider structure allows you to specify various Providers associated with the exam. If the provider has previously been submitted and was done so with NPI, you only need to include the NPI value in the submission . Properties . | Property | Type | Description | . | NPI | string (10) | Providers National Identifier | . | Taxonomy | string | Optionally specify Taxonomy relevant to the action | . | Name | string | First, Last name | . | Email | string | Optionally specify an email address | . | Degrees | string | Optionally supply degrees | . | Associations | string | Optionally supply associations | . Request Patient structure . IRIS allows submitting detailed information on a patient, however, in most workflows the only requirement is Id, Name, DOB and Gender. Providing the starting DxCode (ICD-10) serves as the foundation for a fully qualified ICD-10 code when pathology is found. | Property | Type | Description | Options | . | LocalId | string | Id of patient as specified by the submitting organization. Typically this will the the Patient MRN. |   | . | Name | Name structure | Patient first and last name |   | . | Dob | Date | Patient date of birth |   | . | Gender | options | (Obsolete: Use Genders) Patient Gender abbreviation | Gender options | . | Genders | Array of PersonGender | Patient Gender assignment(s) |   | . | Race | options | Optional race identifier | Race options | . | Ethnicity | options | Optional ethnicity identifier | Ethnicity options | . | PrimaryLanguage | options | Optional language identifier | Language options | . | MaritalStatus | options | Optional marital status identifier | Marital Status options | . | Email | string | Optional email address for patient |   | . | Phone | string | Optional single phone number for patient |   | . | AdditionalInfo | string | Optional free form data association with patient |   | . | Address | Address structure | Optional patient address details |   | . | DxCode | string | ICD-10 code starting diagnosis (default: E08) as defined by CMS |   | . Genders replaces Gender: While the system will still accept a single unspecified gender assignment, it will eventually be phased out in favor of Genders . Request Order structure . What you provide in the Order structure is highly dependent on your workflow. While the only required field is the Evaluation Type to perform, other properties may be required in your workflow. For example, the State field is required for mobile type exams where the location of the exam (where the images are taken) is in a different state than the Site the exam is tied to. See the description of each field for more details. It is highly recommended that you use Order.LocalId as this is the only value you can expect in a subsequent order event that you can cross reference to the order you submitted. The Iris system allows only one open order per patient/evaluation type combination. When using the LocalId, previous (open) orders could automatically be cancelled in favor of the newer order. For this reason, it is recommended that you supply the LocalId field so the system can more clearly identify when cancellations are the desired outcome. Properties . | Property | Type | Description | Options | . | EvaluationTypes | array of option | Specifies which evaluations to perform. Typically, only one evaluation is performed in an order but the Iris system can support multiple thus usage of an array for this field. | DR, Glaucoma, HIV, AMD, DR_AMD | . | ScheduledTime | datetime | When orders are scheduled for a specific time, this should be that time local to the exam location. This is typically used for workflows where orders are pushed to Cameras as this determines which items show in a Camera worklist |   | . | LocalId | string | The Id of the order as specified by the submitting organization. This id is required for subsequent Change and Cancel operations as well as event notifications. |   | . | DepartmentId | string | Optional identifier for the submitting department. Some EMR integrations will require this. |   | . | EncounterNumber | string | Optional identifier for the encounter that generated the order. Some EMR integrations will require this field. |   | . | StudyInstanceUniqueId | DICOM unique id | Optional Identifier, typically used with DICOM integrated cameras |   | . | OrderableIdentifier | string | Optional identifier used by some EMR platforms |   | . | CPTCode | options | Procedure code | See CMS for options | . | AdditionalInfo | string | Free form field for edge cases |   | . | State | string | US State where exam is to be performed. Required for mobile exams that will not be performed at the address specified in the Site. This takes either the State abbreviation or Full name | US State Abbreviations | . | SingleEyeOnly | bool | Specifies that you expect the order to only have images on only one eye. Used in combination with MissingEyeReason. Impacts gradeability scoring. Null=Follow configuration for gradeability with missing eyes, False=Expected but still considered in gradeability, True=Expected and ignore for gradeability | null/true/false | . | MissingEyeReason | string | Specifies the reason the eye was missing. If set, reason is provided in final results |   | . | Urgent | bool | If true the order is prioritized in the grading queue | true/false (default: false) | . HealthPlan structure . If your workflow is based on a Health Plan, this structure may be included in the submission. This information is returned in results. If your workflow includes PCP results delivery, you may specify that Provider here. Properties . | Property | Type | Description | . | LocalId | string | Id of Plan as specified by the submitting organization | . | Name | string | Name of the Health Plan | . | MemberId | string | Id for the HealthPlan member, typically as specified by the Health Plan itself | . | IndividualId | string | Id for the Individual person associated with the Member for the HealthPlan | . | PrimaryCareProvider | PCP structure | Contains Provider information for the PCP of the Member.This information can be used for results submission directly to that provider. | .

    "content": "IRIS provides a secure mechanism for installing Proxy applications. The process generally takes less than 15 minutes. Identify the individual in your organization that will be responsible for this action. IRIS refers to this individual as the Integration Administrator (You may have multiple individuals with this role). Must have access to the computer it will be installed on . o Should have general knowledge of Windows and Windows Services . Should understand the necessity to use a domain level service account should security policies dictate . o Should understand local policies that could prevent the application from being installed . Provide the email address of Integration Administrator to your IRIS onboarding liaison. o Due to the security requirements for Integration, only authorized IRIS employees can invite an Integration Administrator into the IRIS system. • The Integration Administrator will receive an invitation to the IRIS system in an email coming from Microsoft. This is the same process used for onboarding all users into the IRIS system. TEC 001 Rev F CN0059 . CONFIDENTIAL Effective . 010/06/2023 . 。Once registered, Access to the Proxy installation files are available from the IRIS Portal from the Integration Files link (see screen shots below). O Integration Installation files contained here are specific to your environment . Installation files are packaged as MSI. Download the installation file and run it. The only option you will have is whether or not to specify a service account. If not explicitlyset, the default NT Service Account (local) is used. Test system installations . For customers who wish to create a test environment (typically for EMR Proxy integration), notify your onboarding liaison of this requirement. Following the same procedures outlined above, the Integration Administrator must first register in the IRIS production system. The Integration Administrator should then email IRIS support and request setup within the Test environment . | Once the IRIS Support Team has completed the request, the Integration Administrator can then login to the IRIS test portal using https://portal-qa.retinalscreenings.com | .

    "content": "This document outlines the values sent in an HL7 results message (ORU-R01) from IRIS to a third-party system. This third-party system could be another application, an interface engine, or an EMR. For the purposes of this documentation, this third-party will be referred to an EMR. IRIS uses HL7 v2.4 as a main protocol for message sharing. If there are any fields represented in this document that are not populated but required by a receiving EMR, IRIS will populate these value(s) as requested. If the receiving EMR requires a different version, IRIS can provide messages for the corresponding version. If the EMR expects messages to be delivered in a format other than HL7, this will need to be discussed with an IRIS Interface Engineer as this will not be covered in the scope of this document – please contact IRIS support for more information. Following this section, the rest of the document will be divided by HL7 segment types as they would appear in a delivered HL7 message. IRIS has two different methods for delivering the document in an OBX segment: encoded PDF or pointer link (static URL). This will be described in detail later in that section. The last section of this document contains an example HL7 message. Customization . This document provides the default implementation of IRIS results to an HL7 ORU message. These mappings can be customized to suite your requirements. Customization can either be performed by an IRIS integration specialist or if desired you may designate an individual within your organization with the Integrator role providing them access to the IRIS Integration application.

The notable exception is Welch Allyn, whose devices are designed to restrict use outside their network. There are two main points of integration with Cameras: Worklists and Images. The best and most reliable workflow is one in which the patients are available for selection from the camera user interface, without the operator being required to manually enter them. | Orders are submitted to IRIS via Order Processing Integration | Cameras, linked to Site/Departments or Operators, present the patient list | Images are submitted with embedded order details | . The primary and preferred form of camera integration is through DICOM. Generally speaking, you will find DICOM support on most desktop cameras. When DICOM is not available, desktop cameras typically provide some form of file system sharing. Handheld cameras are integrated in a variety of ways. For specific details on all cameras go to our Supported Fundus Cameras page. OCT Cameras . IRIS provides integration with OCT Cameras via DICOM.

This can be as simple as the uploading of a spreadsheet, or as detailed as the implementation of an HL7 interface.
