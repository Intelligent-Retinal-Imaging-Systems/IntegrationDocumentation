# SAAS (Cloud based) EMR Systems

As IRIS is also a SAAS application, Integrating to SAAS based EMR/EHR systems is a natural progression. We do not take the approach of "build it and they will come" rather we engage the vendor at which point a customer using that system enters into a relationship with IRIS. In the majority of cases, the vendor already supports an HL7 feed for such operations and the process of  integrating is routine. Generally speaking, the amount of time it takes to complete an integration is dependent on that vendors availability.

### Vendor Fees
Most SAAS EMR providers charge transaction fees of which there are typically two per order.  In all cases, regardless of the SAAS provider, these fees are passed on to the customer.
