#Camera Integration with IRIS
IRIS supports a variety of intake workflows in order to submit images and have them applied to orders. 

There are two main points of integration with Cameras: Worklists and Images.  
> The best and most reliable workflow is one in which the patients are available for selection from the camera user interface, without the operator being required to manually enter them.  
1. Orders are submitted to IRIS via Order Processing Integration
2. Cameras, linked to Site/Departments or Operators, present the patient list
3. Images are submitted with embedded order details

The primary and preferred form of camera integration is through **DICOM**.  Generally speaking, you will find DICOM support on most desktop cameras.  When DICOM is not available, desktop cameras typically provide some form of file system sharing.  

Handheld cameras are integrated in a variety of ways.

For specific details on all cameras go to our <u>Supported Fundus Cameras</u> page.

### OCT Cameras
IRIS provides integration with OCT Cameras via **DICOM**. For information on specific OCT devices contact IRIS sales support.
