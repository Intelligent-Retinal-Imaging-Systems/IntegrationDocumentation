## FT1 (Option 1) – Financial Transaction

The financial transaction segment contains the detailed data necessary to post charges, payments, adjustments, etc. to patient accounting records. IRIS has the capabilities of sending the FT1 segment by two different means. For the FT1 (Option 1) segment, IRIS sends professional charges (charging for the professional readers alone). There is an additional option for this ‘FT1 (Option 1)’ where IRIS can send an additional FT1 segment containing CPT II. For the FT1 (Option 2) segments, IRIS sends both the professional and technical charges in the HL7 message.
