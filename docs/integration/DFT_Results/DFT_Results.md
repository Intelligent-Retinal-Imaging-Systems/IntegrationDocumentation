## Standard Charge (DFT-P03) Outbound Specifications
IRIS can push a single DFT message per order as a mechanism for dropping charges.

*We recommend dropping charges through your EMR/EHR Ambulatory workflow as a more reliable option to using a DFT Message. You have more information regarding the patient encounter in which to make this determination.*
