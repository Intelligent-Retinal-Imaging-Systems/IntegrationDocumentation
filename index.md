# Integrating to the IRIS Platform

The IRIS platform is built with a rich set of integration tools that allows you to operate from your unique platform using the devices you choose.  We are committed to following already adopted standards whenever possible while providing custom solutions where those standards fall short. These tools are segmented into two categories: Device and Order Processing.

## Devices
### Imaging Equipment
For details on supported devices and how they integrate to the IRIS platform go to the [Imaging Equipment](/docs/integration/CameraIntegration/) page. 

## Order Processing
For details on order processing go to the [Order Processing](/docs/integration/OrderProcessingIntegrations/) page.
