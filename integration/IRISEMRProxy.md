# IRIS EMR Proxy

## Overview
The IRIS EMR Proxy is an application that can be installed on any system running the Windows operating system to provide a variety of integration services to you from the IRIS system.  

## Purpose
The core function of the EMR Proxy is to provide a secure path for data to pass between IRIS and your system.  As an alternative to expensive and complicated *Virtual Private Networks*, the proxy provides safe and reliable transport of data between the cloud and your network. 

## Is it only for EMR/EHR systems?
In short, no.  The application can be used for transferring results to any file system available to the device it is installed on.  It can even be installed on a workstation as long as network requirements are met.

## Who supplies the hardware
As with all IRIS Proxy applications, you must install the application on your own equipment.  

## Support
The Proxy application was designed to be simple, leaving all the complicated operations to IRIS Cloud services.  Because of this, there are not frequent updates and no ongoing maintenance requirements for the application.  

You, as the owner of the equipment, are responsible for the upkeep of the Windows operating system.  

If there are issues with the application, you may reach out to IRIS support for troubleshooting assistance.  There is no initial or ongoing requirement for remote access however you may choose to provide it during a support call.  Most issues can be diagnosed without this access.
