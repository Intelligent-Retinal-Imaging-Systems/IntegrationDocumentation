# Order Processing with IRIS

While the IRIS platform is fully operable through a rich suite of <a href="https://portal.retinalscreenings.com">web based tools</a>, a more seamless workflow can be achieved through integration to your own platform. There are two main points of integration: Submission and Delivery.

> Order Submission is the process of submitting patients/orders to IRIS from your system.  This can be as simple as the uploading of a spreadsheet, or as detailed as the implementation of an HL7 interface.  

> Results Delivery is the process of returning the result of an exam to your system (and/or related endpoints).  As with Submissions, there are a wide breadth of options available to meet your specific needs.
